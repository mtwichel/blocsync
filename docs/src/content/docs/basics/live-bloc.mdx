`LiveBloc` is a bloc that syncs its state across devices in real-time. It works by
1. Fetching the most recent state from the server.
2. Subscribing to the server to receive events from all other devices.
3. Writing the updated state to the server (only from the device that made the change).

## Usage

To use `LiveBloc`, first, simply extend it instead of `Bloc`. Next, add the `LiveEvent` mixin to your event class.


```dart
import 'package:blocsync/blocsync.dart';

class CounterBloc extends LiveBloc<CounterEvent, int> {
  CounterBloc() : super(0) {
    on<Increment>((event, emit) => emit(state + 1));
    on<Decrement>((event, emit) => emit(state - 1));
  }
}

abstract class CounterEvent with LiveEvent {}

class Increment extends CounterEvent {}

class Decrement extends CounterEvent {}
```

:::note[]
There is no `LiveCubit`, only `LiveBloc`. This is because `LiveBloc` _doesn't_ sync states, only events.
Since Cubits don't have events, they can't be synced in this way.

## Other Features

`LiveBloc`s can be made private and partitioned just like `SyncedBloc`s. For more information, see [Private Blocs](/basics/private-blocs) and [Partitioned Blocs](/basics/partitioned-blocs).


## Why Sync Events instead of States?

A lot of debate went into this decision. In the end, the decision came down to some future plans.

Primarily, we plan to support `SharedBloc`s soon, which will allow you to sync states across multiple users. However, this will require much more sophisticated security than private blocs. Some questions we asked were:

- How to we allow certain users to read state and others manipulate it?
- How do we allow certain users to manipulate state in some ways, but others manipulate it in different ways?

We realized that we could restrict user's abilities to send events, and that would restrict their ability to manipulate state.

It does have some drawbacks. It means
- We can't support a `LiveCubit`
- States are not guaranteed to be in sync across devices perfectly. If a user misses an event, the state will be out of sync.

We're open to feedback on this decision. If you have feedback, please let us know in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mtwichel/blocsync/discussions).
